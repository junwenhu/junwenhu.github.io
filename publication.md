**Does online dating make relationships more successful? Replication and extension of a previous study**
<br>[Junwen Hu](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/junwen-hu), [Rui Zhu](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/rui-cara-zhu), and [Yue Zhang](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/yue-zhang)

<br>*Computers in Human Behavior*, Jul, 2024.
<br>[PDF](https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1jQPv2f%7EUWQUzj)
<br>**Key concern**<br>I showed what online dating outcomes are related to people's beliefs about dating algorithms.<br><br>

**Algorithm awareness in online dating: associations with mate-searching difficulty and future expectancies among U.S. online daters**
<br>[Junwen Hu](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/junwen-hu) and [Emily (Shuo) Zhan](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/shuo-emily-zhan)

<br>**Key concern**<br>In this work, we demonstrated the benefits of being more algorithm-aware in online dating and relevant gender differences. <br>

**The relationship between preference for online social interaction and affective well-being via compulsive 
dating app use: The moderating role of algorithmic beliefs**

<br>*International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction*, May, 2023.
<br>[PDF](https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2023.2217014) | [Measures](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371169210_Familiarity_Breeds_Trust_The_Relationship_between_Dating_App_Use_and_Trust_in_Dating_Algorithms_via_Algorithm_Awareness_and_Critical_Algorithm_Perceptions?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InByb2ZpbGUiLCJwYWdlIjoicHJvZmlsZSIsInBvc2l0aW9uIjoicGFnZUNvbnRlbnQifX0)
<br>**Key concern**<br>With a mixed-methods design, we showed how online daters make sense of dating algorithms and how that varied by usage. <br>

**Exploring the impact of a ‘confining’ imaginary of user-recommendation systems on platform usage and relationship 
development among dating app users**
<br>[Junwen Hu](https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/junwen-hu)
