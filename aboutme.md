title: About me
subtitle: Why interested in relationship decisions?  
---

I was rasied in a suburban working-class family in Southern China. I went to [Nanjing University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_University), a member of the elitist [C9 League universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C9_League), where I received my BA in Advertising (Graduation with Honor) and MA in Journalism and Communication. 

I am a first-generation college student. Going to an elite university forced me to mingle into groups of people from very different backgrounds. Every day, it felt like there were many relationship decisions for me to make, each leading to a different future. This great experience has been inspiring me to study how relationships are formed and evolve in contemporary societies of high social mobilities, and which approaches to making relationship decisions bring more rewards for agents like me and you. I am happy to have built an exciting line of research that addresses critical contemporary problems from relationships and technology perspectives.  

In my leisure time, I like learning languages. Though not a language major, I was a certified translator and interpreter. I am also actively learning German and Spanish. 

I am looking forward to chatting with you. My work can be found through [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=duu3b-IAAAAJ&hl). You may reach out to me through the contact icons below. 

P. S. You are saying my name right-it's Jun-wen Hu (Who).
