title: About me
subtitle: Why relationships and technology? 
---

I was rasied in a suburban working-class family in Southern China. I went to [Nanjing University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_University), a member of the elitist [C9 League universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C9_League), where I received my BA in Advertising (Graduation with Honor) and MA in Journalism and Communication. 

I am a first-generation college student. Going to an elite university forces me to mingle into groups of people from very different backgrounds. I heavily utilized digital platforms to manage these relationships. This great experience has been inspiring me to study how relationships are formed in contemporary societies of high social mobilities. I am happy to have built an exciting line of research program that addresses critical contemporary problems from relationships and technology perspectives.  

In my leisure time, I like learning languages. Though not a language major, I was a certified translator, interpretor. I am also actively learning German and Spanish. 

If you are interested, I invite you to read my [work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=duu3b-IAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and share your thoughts with me. 

P. S. A quick way to pronounce my name is June-One.
