title: About me
subtitle: Why relational communication? 
---

I was rasied in a suburban working-class family in Southern China. I went to [Nanjing University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_University), a member of the top [C9 League universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C9_League), where I received my BA in Advertising (Graduation with Honor) and MA in Journalism and Communication. 

Going into an elite university as a first-gen gave me a lot of unexpected experiences. I learned the great disparities between people from different backgrounds. During this period, I began to seriously read and think about human standing in contempoary society where they have to move and mingle into different communities - even people sometimes avoid doing so. This prompts me to pursue my line of research in answering the question of how people are happy or miserable because of the way they approach relationships via interaction messages, networks, and technologies. I am very happy that, after five years since when I decided to pursue a PhD, I now have built an exciting line of research program that is answering social questions from relational communication perspectives. 

If you are interested, I invite you to read my [work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=duu3b-IAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and share your thoughts with me. 

P. S. An easy way to pronounce my name is June-One.
