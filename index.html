I am a Ph.D. candidate (ABD) at <a href="https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/junwen-hu/">the Department of Communication in Michigan State University</a>. 
I study relationships and technology. 
My findings are published in journals like the <i>Journal of Social and Personal Relationshops</i> and <i>Computers in Human Behavior</i>. Some of them are covered by scientific media like
PsyPost (<a href="https://www.psypost.org/online-dating-and-relationship-success-the-potential-role-of-social-media-sharing/">2024</a>, <a href="https://www.psypost.org/why-your-friends-may-be-better-for-your-mental-health-than-your-partner/">2025</a>). 

<br><br>
I am good at identifying problems and employ various data types (e.g., experimental, longitudinal, network) and advanced statistical models (e.g., SEM, MLM) to generate insights and offer solutions.
