I am a Ph.D. candidate (ABD) at <a href="https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/junwen-hu/">the Department of Communication in Michigan State University</a>. 
I study relationships and technology. 
My findings are published in journals like the <i>Journal of Social and Personal Relationshops</i> and <i>Computers in Human Behavior</i>. Some of them are covered by scientific media like
PsyPost (<a href="https://www.psypost.org/online-dating-and-relationship-success-the-potential-role-of-social-media-sharing/">2024</a>, <a href="https://www.psypost.org/why-your-friends-may-be-better-for-your-mental-health-than-your-partner/">2025</a>). 

<br><br>
I am good at identifying problems and employ various data types (e.g., experimental, longitudinal, network) and advanced statistical models (e.g., SEM, MLM) to generate insights and offer solutions. 

<br><br>
I have been focused on three research lines. First, I study how does AI-driven technology, like <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2023.2217014">algorithms</a>, shape <a href="https://liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2024.0136">formation of relationships</a> and social structure at large. 
<br>
Second, I examine the link between the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2024.2404262">structure of voluntary relationships</a> and personal well-being. 
<br>
Third, I explore how social support is provided within the structure of voluntary relationships. 
<br><br>
My research was funded by the <b>Strosacker Research Grant</b>. I was also funded by the University of Michigan to Participate in the Summer Training Session of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (<b>ICPSR</b>)
