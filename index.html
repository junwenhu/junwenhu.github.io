subtitle: Relationship-seeking in high-choice social and media environments
---

<br>I am a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/junwen-hu/">the Department of Communication, Michigan State University</a>. 
I study the processes of people <b>seeking relationships in high-choice social and media enviroments</b>, from online mate-searching to
taking care of the psychological distress from bad relationship-seeking experience. With such a focus, my research 
topics encompass online dating, social network, social support, algorithm, artificial intelligence (AI), and misinformation. <br>
