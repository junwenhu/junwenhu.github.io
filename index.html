I am a Ph.D. candidate (ABD) at <a href="https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/junwen-hu/">the Department of Communication in Michigan State University</a>. 
My research seeks to understand human behaviors through relational communication, looking at the structure of the relationships between people, content of messages they exchange, and technologies they use to interact.
My findings are published in journals like the <i>Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</i> and <i>Computers in Human Behavior</i>. Some of them are covered by scientific media like
PsyPost (<a href="https://www.psypost.org/online-dating-and-relationship-success-the-potential-role-of-social-media-sharing/">2024</a>, <a href="https://www.psypost.org/why-your-friends-may-be-better-for-your-mental-health-than-your-partner/">2025</a>). 

<br><br>
I am good at identifying problems and employ various data types (e.g., experimental, longitudinal, network) and advanced statistical models (e.g., SEM, MLM) to generate insights and offer solutions. 

<br><br>
I have been focused on three research lines. First, I study how AI-driven technology, like <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2023.2217014">algorithms</a>, shapes <a href="https://liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2024.0136">formation of relationships</a> and social structure at large. 
<br><br>
Second, I examine the link between the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2024.2404262">structure of voluntary relationships</a> and personal well-being. 
<br><br>
Third, I explore how <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02654075251337895">social support</a> is provided within the structure of voluntary relationships. 
<br><br>
My research was funded by the <b>Strosacker Research Grant</b>. I was also funded by the University of Michigan to Participate in the Summer Training Session of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (<b>ICPSR</b>)
