I am a Ph.D. candidate (all-but-dissertation) at <a href="https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/junwen-hu/">the Department of Communication, Michigan State University</a>. 
I devote my research to developing supportive communication strategies that promote social and emotional well-being and resilience, employing various data types and advanced statistical models. These communication strategies involve messages, networks, and technologies. 
The work I led was published in impactful journals like <i>Journal of Social and Personal Relationshops</i>, <i>Computers in Human Behavior</i>, and <i>Cyberpsychology</i> and reported by scientific media like
<a href="https://phys.org/news/2024-08-online-dating-relationships-successful.html">PsyPost</a> and 
<a href="https://www.psypost.org/online-dating-and-relationship-success-the-potential-role-of-social-media-sharing/">Phys.org</a>. 

<br><br>
Holding two degrees in applied communication (Nanjing University) and now PhD'ing at the first Communication Department in the US, known for its theoretical training, I am passionate about developing social scientific theories that address real-world problems. 
<br><br>
The specific areas I focus on mainly include: online dating, social support, relationships, and well-being. I am familiar with mediation/moderation, structural equation modeling, mixed effects modeling, and social network analysis. 
I am comfortable with designing surveys and message experiments and also exploring existing datasets to answer research questions of interest.
