I am a Ph.D. candidate (ABD) at <a href="https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/junwen-hu/">the Department of Communication in Michigan State University</a>. 
My research examines how people can make relationship decisions that lead to happy and fulfilling lives. Specifically, I look at <a href="https://liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2024.0136">AI technologies that mediate relationship formation (e.g., online dating algorithms)</a>, 
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02654075251321385">the structure of the relationships between people</a>, and
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02654075251337895">the content of messages they exchange</a>.
My findings are published in journals like the <i>Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</i> and <i>Computers in Human Behavior</i>. Some of them are covered by media in more than one language, for example, 
  <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-single/202505/which-protects-best-from-depression-friendship-or-romance">Psychology Today</a>, 
<a href="https://www.psypost.org/online-dating-and-relationship-success-the-potential-role-of-social-media-sharing/">PsyPost</a>, and <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/v-zuP1zybWvO_2YK-50pHQ">MsMuses 缪斯夫人</a>. 

<br><br>
As a researcher, I am good at identifying problems and employ various data types (e.g., experimental, longitudinal, network) and advanced statistical models (e.g., SEM, MLM) to generate insights and offer solutions. 

My research has received strong funding support, for example, by the <b>Strosacker Research Grant</b>. I was also funded by the University of Michigan to Participate in the Summer Training Session of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (<b>ICPSR</b>)
