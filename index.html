I am a Ph.D. candidate (ABD) at <a href="https://comartsci.msu.edu/our-people/junwen-hu/">the Department of Communication in Michigan State University</a>. 
My research examines how people can make relationship decisions that lead to happy and fulfilling lives. Specifically, I look at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/pere.70012">the structure of the relationships between people</a>, 
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02654075251337895">social support</acontent of messages they exchange</a>, and 
  <a href="https://liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2024.0136">technologies they use to interact</a>.
My findings are published in journals like the <i>Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</i> and <i>Computers in Human Behavior</i>. Some of them are covered by media in more than one language, for example, 
PsyPost (<a href="https://www.psypost.org/online-dating-and-relationship-success-the-potential-role-of-social-media-sharing/">2024</a>, <a href="https://www.psypost.org/why-your-friends-may-be-better-for-your-mental-health-than-your-partner/">2025</a>) and 缪斯夫人（upcoming）.

As a researcher, I am good at identifying problems and employ various data types (e.g., experimental, longitudinal, network) and advanced statistical models (e.g., SEM, MLM) to generate insights and offer solutions. 

My research was frequently funded, for example, by the <b>Strosacker Research Grant</b>. I was also funded by the University of Michigan to Participate in the Summer Training Session of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (<b>ICPSR</b>)
